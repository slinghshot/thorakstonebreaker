        <h3>Backstory</h3>
        <p>
          Tharok was once the pride of the Ironmaw Clan—a warrior whose strength
          was matched only by his ambition. His deeds on the battlefield were
          sung in campfires, his name carried with respect and fear. He took
          Kaera, a fierce hunter from a neighboring clan, as his wife, and
          together they raised seven children—each strong, sharp-eyed, and bred
          for survival. His life seemed carved from legend. Then came the raid
          that changed everything. Ordered to slaughter a rival clan’s
          survivors, Tharok hesitated before a cowering family—too reminiscent
          of his own. His mercy was seen as betrayal. Brought before the clan
          council, with Kaera watching in silence and his children held back by
          warriors, he was exiled.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p style="text-align: center">
          <span class="new-rocker" style="color: rgb(204, 28, 28)"
            >"Mercy weakens us,"</span
          >
          his father spat.
          <span
            class="new-rocker"
            style="color: rgb(204, 28, 28); font-size: 14pt"
            >"You are no Ironmaw."</span
          >
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Stripped of his clan marks, Tharok was cast into the wilds. He turned
          back only once—to see his youngest child reaching out to him, soldiers
          pulling them away.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          His rage boiled beneath his skin, not just for the betrayal but for
          what it cost him: his family. The Ironmaw claimed to act for the
          clan’s good—but they robbed his children of their father. Kaera
          remained with the clan, bound by tradition, though Tharok never forgot
          the fire in her eyes that night—a mix of sorrow and anger.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Now, Tharok roams the world, seeking glory not for redemption—but for
          power. If he becomes a legend, the Ironmaw will be forced to remember
          him. And when he’s strong enough? He’ll return—not begging for
          acceptance but demanding a reckoning. His children will know his name,
          whether by stories of his conquests or by his blade cutting through
          those who kept them apart.
